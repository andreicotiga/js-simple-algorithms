# Simple algorithms

#### Basic algorithm exemplification in javascript, used for teaching

## Algorithms exemplified (alphabetically):
- Balanced Parentheses Determination
- Shortest path using Bellman-Ford
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Shortest path using Dijkstra
- Factorial computation
- Fibonacci computation
- Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Denominator of to number
- Merge Sort
- Finding prime numbers
- Quick sort
- Recursively reversing a string
- Selection sort

## Testing the algorithms:

Download and install node.js if you don't have it installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Run:

`npm install` - will install the required packages

`npm test` - will run the unit tests
